     <h3>Before and After Treatment Results!</h3>
     <p>
        When a person's teeth or jaw structure do not fit together properly, orthodontic treatment may be necessary to straight the teeth and promote the ideal function. These problems are often referred to as malocclusion (or bad bites), can cause speech difficulty , premature wear of the teeth and protective enamel and even increase the chance of injury to teth and jaw joints, if left untreated.
